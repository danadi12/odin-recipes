      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini and cook
        until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, rinse with
        cold water, and drain again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer drained, cooked pasta to a large bowl. Add pepperoni, provolone
        cheese, red onion, cucumber, bell peppers, olives, parsley, and Parmesan
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix olive oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, oregano, ground mustard, salt,
        and pepper for dressing in a jar with a lid. Seal the jar, and shake
        until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour dressing over the pasta salad; toss until well coated. Serve
        immediately, or cover and chill in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours
        before serving.
